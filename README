= aptinstaller

* http://github.com/ngauthier/aptinstaller/tree/master

== DESCRIPTION:
This gem installs packages through apt-get in a similar manner as geminstaller installs gems.

== Usage:
aptinstaller [/full/path/to/rails/project/root]

== INCOMPLETE ==
* Currently it doesn't do anything. I'm just trying to rake the gem.

== SYNOPSIS:

Put this in config/aptinstaller.yml:

---
packages:
  - executable: firefox
  - executable: MP4Box
    package: gpac

The executable field is the name of the executable (i.e. $ MP4Box). If the package's name in the
repositories is different from the executable, specify the package name with the "package"
field (i.e. "gpac" which provides the MP4Box executable).

Then in config/preinitializer.rb (create it if it doesn't exist, it's pulled automatically
from boot.rb):

require 'rubygems'
require 'aptinstaller'
AptInstaller.autopkg(:config => 'config/aptinstaller.yml')

== REQUIREMENTS:

* a rails app that requires apt packages

== INSTALL:

rake gem
sudo gem install pkg/aptinstaller-0.1.0.gem
